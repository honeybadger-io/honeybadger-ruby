### Fixed
- Logging breadcrumbs will not crash anymore when logging is done using a block
  form. -@Bajena

### Changed
- Default `max_queue_size` has been reduced from 1000 to 100.

### Added
- Added `Notice#causes`, which allows cause data to be mutated in
  `before_notify` callbacks (useful for filtering purposes).

### Fixed
- Fix #301 - before_notify hooks are overridden on subsequent
  `Honeybadger.configure` calls.
- Revert "Get the right controller / action name in Rails, when using an
  exception app for custom error pages."

## [4.2.0] - 2019-01-31

### Added
- Added flag `--skip-rails-load` to cli commands for optionally skipping Rails initialization when running from a Rails root.

### Fixed
- Added missing Backend::Server#check_in specs
- Fix a memory leak in the worker queue (jruby)

## [4.0.0] - 2018-08-21
### Added
- Added `before_notify` hooks to be defined, this allows setting up of multiple
  hooks which will be invoked with a `notice` before a `notice` is sent. Each
  `before_notify` hook MUST be a `callable` (lambda, Proc etc,) with an arity of 1.
- Added the ability to halt notices in callbacks using `notice.halt!`
- Make essential attributes on Notice writable:
  ```ruby
  Honeybadger.configure do |config|
    config.before_notify do |notice|
      notice.api_key = 'custom api key',
      notice.error_message = "badgers!",
      notice.error_class = 'MyError',
      notice.backtrace = ["/path/to/file.rb:5 in `method'"],
      notice.fingerprint = 'some unique string',
      notice.tags = ['foo', 'bar'],
      notice.context = { user: 33 },
      notice.controller = 'MyController',
      notice.action = 'index',
      notice.parameters = { q: 'badgers?' },
      notice.session = { uid: 42 },
      notice.url = "/badgers",
    end
  end
  ```

### Fixed
- Ignore SIGTERM SignalExceptions.

### Removed
- Removed Notice#[]

### Changed
- The public method `Notice#backtrace` is now exposed as the raw Ruby
  backtrace instead of an instance of `Honeybadger::Backtrace` (a private
  class).

  Before:
  ```ruby
  notice.backtrace # => #<Honeybadger::Backtrace>
  ```

  After:
  ```ruby
  notice.backtrace # => ["/path/to/file.rb:5 in `method'"]
  ```
- `notice[:context]` now defaults to an empty Hash instead of nil.

  Before:
  ```ruby
  notice[:context] # => nil
  ```

  After:
  ```ruby
  notice[:context] # => {}
  ```
- The public method `Notice#fingerprint` now returns the original
  String which was passed in from the `:fingerprint` option or the
  `exception_fingerprint` callback, not a SHA1 hashed value. The value is
  still hashed before sending through to the API.
- The public method `Honeybadger.exception_filter` has been deprecated in favor
  of `before_notify`:
  ```ruby
  Honeybadger.configure do |config|
    config.before_notify do |notice|
      notice.halt!
    end
  end
  ```
- The public method `Honeybadger.exception_fingerprint` has been deprecated in favor
  of `before_notify`:
  ```ruby
  Honeybadger.configure do |config|
    config.before_notify do |notice|
      notice.fingerprint = 'new fingerprint'
    end
  end
  ```
- The public method `Honeybadger.backtrace_filter` has been deprecated in favor
  of `before_notify`:
  ```ruby
  Honeybadger.configure do |config|
    config.before_notify do |notice|
      notice.backtrace.reject!{|x| x =~ /gem/}
    end
  end
  ```

### Removed
- The `disabled` option is now removed, Use the `report_data` option instead.

## [3.3.1] - 2018-08-02
### Fixed
- Fix synchronous throttling in shoryuken

## [3.3.0] - 2018-01-29
### Changed
- Use prepend to add Sidekiq Middleware to fix context getting cleared.
- Add `Rack::QueryParser::ParameterTypeError` and
  `Rack::QueryParser::InvalidParameterError` to default ignore list.

### Fixed
- Use a unique route name in rails to avoid name conflicts.
- Fix `at_exit` callback being skipped in rails apps with a sinatra dependency.

## [3.2.0] - 2017-11-27
### Changed
- Objects which explicitly alias `#to_s` to `#inspect` (such as `OpenStruct`) are
  now sanitized. `'#<OpenStruct attribute="value">'` becomes `'#<OpenStruct>'`.
  If you pass the value of `#inspect` (as a `String`) directly to Honeybadger (or
  return it from `#to_honeybadger`), the value will not be sanitized.
- We're now using `String(object)` instead of `object.to_s` as the last resort
  during sanitization.

### Added
- The exception cause may now be set using an optional `:cause` option when
  calling `Honeybadger.notify`. If not present, the exception's cause will be
  used, or the global `$!` exception if available.
- Any object can now act as context using the `#to_honeybadger_context` method.
  The method should have no arguments and return a `Hash` of context data.
  Context from exceptions which define this method will automatically be
  included in error reports.
- Final object representations in Honeybadger (normally the value of `#to_s`
  for unknown types) can be changed by defining the `#to_honeybadger` method. If
  the method is defined, the return value of that method will be sent to Honeybadger
  instead of the `#to_s` value (for context values, local variables, etc.).
- `'[RAISED]'` is returned when `object.to_honeybadger` or `String(object)` fails.
- Added `Honeybadger.check_in` method which allows performing check ins from ruby.

### Fixed
- We no longer use "/dev/null" as the default log device as it doesn't exist on
  Windows.
- Logs when reporting errors in development mode now mention that the error wasn't
  *actually* reported. :)
- Support new Sidekiq job params key.
- Move at_exit callback to an appropriate place for sinatra apps, so that it does
  not prematurely stop honeybadger workers.
- `BasicObject`, which previously could not be serialized, is now serialized as
  `"#<BasicObject>"`.

## [3.1.2] - 2017-04-20
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the Resque plugin which prevented error reports from being
  sent. The issue was that the Resque's callbacks were executed in an unexpected
  order which caused the queue to be flushed before error notification instead
  of after.

## [3.1.1] - 2017-04-13
### Fixed
- `honeybadger deploy` cli command now reads default environment from
  honeybadger.yml/environment variable.
- Fixed a conflict with the web-console gem.

## [3.1.0] - 2017-03-01
### Changed
- Exceptions encountered while loading/evaluating honeybadger.yml are now raised
  instead of logged.

### Added
- Friendlier backtraces for exceptions originating in honeybadger.yml.
- Notify errors in Shoryuken batches -@phstc

### Fixed
- Rails environment is now loaded when running `honeybadger` cli from a Rails
  root. This fixes an issue where programmatic configuration from Rails was not
  loaded.
- Fixed logger isn't being overridden properly when configuring with
  Honeybadger.configure -@anujbiyani

## [3.0.2] - 2017-02-16
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug caused by an interaction with the semantic\_logger gem.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-02-10
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug which caused a NoMethodError (undefined method \`start_with?') when
  Rack env contained non-string keys.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-02-06
### Added
- You may now require 'honeybadger/ruby' instead of 'honeybadger' to get the
  agent without the integrations (no railtie, plugins or monkey patching).
- You can now create multiple instances of the Honeybadger agent with different
  configurations (many classes in the library can be composed).
- `Honeybadger.configure` works again -- use it to configure the library from
  Ruby! (we still default to honeybadger.yml in our installer)
- Our test suite is now leaner and meaner (which means we can add new features
  faster). Reduced typical build times from up to 2 minutes to 20 seconds.
- We've rebuilt the CLI from scratch. The new CLI features super verbose error
  messages with (hopefully) helpful suggestions, some new commands, and better
  framework detection in the `install` and `test` commands.
- Use `honeybadger exec your_command` from the command line to report the error
  when the command fails due to a non-zero exit status or standard error output.
  (Use it to report failures in cron!) See `honeybadger help exec`.
- Use `honeybadger notify` from the command line to report custom errors to
  Honeybadger. See `honeybadger help notify`.
- ~/honeybadger.yml is now a default config path for the CLI and standalone-ruby
  installations.
- `Honeybadger.notify` now converts arguments which are not `Exception` or
  `Hash` types to strings and assigns them as the error message. Example:
  `Honeybadger.notify("Something went wrong")`.
- The currently deployed git revision is now detected automatically and sent
  with error reports.

### Changed
- `Honeybadger.start` has been deprecated and has no effect.
- We've changed some of the underlying code of the library. If you depend on
  internal APIs (such as thread local variable names or any functions not marked
  public in the code comments) then you may need to update your code. If you are
  developing 3rd-party integrations with our gem [let us
  know](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/issues) so that we can
  work with you to build the public APIs you need.
- All Rack middleware no longer require an argument (which used to be a
  `Honeybadger::Config` instance) when using them. They now default to the
  global agent and accept an optional argument which expects an alternate
  `Honeybadger::Agent` instance.
- The *plugins.skip* config option has been renamed to *skipped_plugins*.
- The *sidekiq.use_component* config option is now `true` by default. To get the
  old behavior, set it to `false`. When enabled, the Sidekiq plugin will
  automatically set the component to the class of the job, which helps with
  grouping.
- The `request.filter_keys` option now includes partial matches: with the filter
  value "password", keys such as "password" and "otherpassword" will be
  filtered.
- CGI variables are now whitelisted when sending the Rack environment to
  Honeybadger to prevent sensitive data leakage.
- `Honeybadger.notify` now raises an exception in development mode when called
  without the required arguments. It logs outside of development and continues
  to send a generic error report.

### Removed
- Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0.x are no longer supported.
- `Honeybadger.notify_or_ignore` has been removed. Use `Honeybadger.notify(e)`
  and `Honeybadger.notify(e, force: true)` (to skip ignore filters).
- The CLI command `honeybadger config` has been removed.
- All deprecated Rails controller methods (from version 1.x) have been removed.
- The deprecated `Honeybadger::Rack::MetricsReporter` middleware has been
  removed.

### Fixed
- Arrays are no longer compacted during sanitization (`nil` values will be sent
  as they originally appeared).
- Resque plugin now reports `Resque::DirtyExit` exceptions.

## [2.7.2] - 2016-12-12
### Fixed
- Pass whole exception to `notify_or_ignore` (includes causes). -@CGamesPlay

## [2.7.1] - 2016-11-16
### Fixed
- Fix a Sinatra bug where `RACK_ENV` default was not used as default env.
