# Honeybadger for Ruby

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/honeybadger.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/honeybadger)

This is the notifier gem for integrating apps with the :zap: [Honeybadger Exception Notifier for Ruby and Rails](http://honeybadger.io).

When an uncaught exception occurs, Honeybadger will POST the relevant data to the Honeybadger server specified in your environment.

## Supported Ruby versions

| Ruby Interpreter  | Supported Version  |
| ----              | ----               |
| MRI               | >= 2.1.0           |
| JRuby             | >= 9.1             |

## Supported web frameworks

| Framework     | Version       | Native?    |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------|
| Rails         | >= 3.2        | yes        |
| Sinatra       | >= 1.2.1      | yes        |
| Rack          | >= 1.0        | middleware |

Rails and Sinatra are supported natively (install/configure the gem and you're done). For vanilla Rack apps, we provide a collection of middleware that must be installed manually.

To use Rails 2.x, you'll need to use an earlier version of the Honeybadger gem. [Go to version 1.x of the gem docs](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/blob/1.16-stable/docs/index.md). 

Integrating with other libraries/frameworks is simple! [See the documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/honeybadger/) to learn about our public API, and see [Contributing](#contributing) to suggest a patch.

## Supported job queues

| Library       | Version       | Native?      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Sidekiq       | any           | yes          |
| Resque        | any           | yes          |
| Delayed Job   | any           | yes          |
| Sucker Punch  | any           | yes          |
| Shoryuken     | any           | yes          |

## Other integrations

| Library       | Version       | Native?      | Description |

| Thor          | any           | yes          | Exceptions in commands are automatically reported. |

You can integrate honeybadger into any Ruby script via the `Honeybadger.notify` method.

## Getting Started

Honeybadger works out of the box with all popular Ruby frameworks. Installation is just a matter of including the gem and setting your API key. In this section, we'll cover the basics. More advanced installations are covered later. 

### 1. Install the gem


The first step is to add the honeybadger gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'honeybadger'
```

Tell bundler to install:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

### 2. Set your API key

Next, you'll set the API key for this project.

```bash
$ bundle exec honeybadger install [YOUR API KEY HERE]
```

This will generate a `config/honeybadger.yml` file. If you don't like config files, you can place your API key in the `$HONEYBADGER_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### Heroku installation

If your app is deployed to heroku, you can configure Honeybadger on your dynos like so:

```bash
$ bundle exec honeybadger heroku install [YOUR API KEY HERE]
```

This will automatically add a `HONEYBADGER_API_KEY` environment variable to your
remote Heroku config and configure deploy notifications.

This step isn't necessary if you're using our [Heroku add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/honeybadger).

### 3. Set up your code

#### Rails

You're done! Any rake tasks and job queues that load the Rails environment are also covered. 

For more info, check out our screencast on getting up and running with Honeybadger and Rails:

[![Using the Honeybadger gem with Rails](https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/e1e2133b8f1bec224c57f6677f6bdb11691b3822.jpg?image_play_button=true&image_play_button_color=7b796ae0&image_crop_resized=150x84)](https://honeybadger.wistia.com/medias/l3cmyucx8f)

#### Sinatra

All you need to do is to include the honeybadger gem: 

```ruby
# Always require Sinatra first.
require 'sinatra'
# Then require honeybadger.
require 'honeybadger'
# Define your application code *after* Sinatra *and* honeybadger:
get '/' do
  raise "Sinatra has left the building"
end
```

To see an example of a sinatra implementation, check out this video:

[![Using the Honeybadger gem with Sinatra](https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/7c9b6e6831f2288874f24d10eec88116e9f378eb.jpg?image_play_button=true&image_play_button_color=7b796ae0&image_crop_resized=150x84)](https://honeybadger.wistia.com/medias/b2wr5n9fcv)

#### Rack

With rack, you have to do things manually, but it's still just a few lines of code:

```ruby
require 'rack'

# Load the gem
require 'honeybadger'

# Write your app
app = Rack::Builder.app do
  run lambda { |env| raise "Rack down" }
end

# Use Honeybadger's rack middleware
use Honeybadger::Rack::ErrorNotifier

run app
```


## Advanced Configuration

There are a few ways to configure the Honeybadger gem. You can use a YAML config file. You can use environment variables. Or you can use a combination of the two. 

We put together a short video highligting a few of the most common configuration options:

[![Advanced Honeybadger Gem Usage](https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/5fccf29d2b27d0f7ec62b5b39e2f5d9cd1f6f5b7.jpg?image_play_button=true&image_play_button_color=7b796ae0&image_crop_resized=150x84)](https://honeybadger.wistia.com/medias/vv9qq9x39d)


### YAML Configuration File

By default, Honeybadger looks for a `honeybadger.yml` configuration file in the root of your project, and then `config/honeybadger.yml` (in that order). 

Here's what the simplest config file looks like:

```yaml
---
api_key: "my_api_key"
```

#### Nested Options

Some configuration options are written in YAML as nested hashes. For example, here's what the `logging.path` and `request.filter_keys` options look like in YAML:

```yaml
---
logging:
  path: "/path/to/honeybadger.log" 
request:
  filter_keys:
    - "credit_card"
```

#### Environments

Environment-specific options can be set by name-spacing the options beneath the environment name. For example:

```yaml
---
api_key: "my_api_key"
production:
  logging:
    path: "/path/to/honeybadger.log"
    level: "WARN"
```

#### ERB and Regex

The configuration file is rendered using ERB. That means you can set configuration options programmatically. You can also include regular expressions. Here's what that looks like:

```yaml
---
api_key: "<%= MyApplication.config.api_key %>"
request:
  filter_keys:
    - !ruby/regexp '/credit_card/i'
```

### Configuring with Environment Variables (12-factor style)

All configuration options can also be read from environment variables (ENV). To do this, uppercase the option name, replace all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores, and prefix with `HONEYBADGER_`. For example, `logging.path` becomes `HONEYBADGER_LOGGING_PATH`:

```
export HONEYBADGER_LOGGING_PATH=/path/to/honeybadger.log
```

ENV options override other options read from framework or `honeybadger.yml` sources, so both can be used together. 

## Configuration Options

You can use any of the options below in your config file, or in the environment.

## Public Methods 

> What follows is a summary of the gem's most commonly-used public methods. For a more authoritative list, read the [full API documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/honeybadger/Honeybadger).


### `Honeybadger.context()`: Set metadata to be sent if an exception occurs

Sometimes, default exception data just isn't enough. If you have extra data that will help you in debugging, send it as part of an error's context. [View full method documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/honeybadger/Honeybadger%3Acontext)

Global context is stored in a thread local variable and automatically reported with any exception which occurs within the current thread's execution.

#### Use this method if:

* You want to record the current user's id at the time of an exception
* You need to send raw POST data for use in debugging
* You have any other metadata you'd like to send with an exception

#### Examples:

```ruby
Honeybadger.context({my_data: 'my value'})

# Inside a Rails controller:
before_action do
  Honeybadger.context({user_id: current_user.id})
end

# Clearing global context:
Honeybadger.context.clear!
```

---


### `Honeybadger.notify()`: Send an exception to Honeybadger.

You normally won't have to use this method. Honeybadger detects and reports errors automatically in Rails and other popular frameworks. But there may be times when you need to manually control exception reporting. [View full method documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/honeybadger/Honeybadger%3Anotify)

#### Use this method if:

* You've rescued an exception, but still want to report it
* You need to report an exception outside of a supported framework. 
* You want complete control over what exception data is sent to us. 


#### Examples:

```ruby
# Sending an exception that you've already rescued
begin
  fail 'oops'
rescue => exception
  Honeybadger.notify(exception) 
end
```

---

### `Honeybadger.exception_filter()`: Programmatically ignore exceptions

This method lets you add a callback that will be run every time an exception is about to be reported to Honeybadger. If your callback returns a truthy value, the exception won't be reported. [View full method documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/honeybadger/Honeybadger%3Aexception_filter)

#### Use this method if:

* You need to ignore exceptions that meet complex criteria
* The built-in configuration options for filtering based on exception class and user agent aren't enough

#### Examples:

```ruby
# Here's how you might ignore exceptions based on their error message:
Honeybadger.exception_filter do |notice|
  notice[:error_message] =~ /sensitive data/
end
```

You can access any attribute on the `notice` argument by using the `[]` syntax. For a full list of attributes, see the [documentation for `Notice`](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/honeybadger/Honeybadger/Notice#%5B%5D-instance_method) Here are a few examples to get you started:

```ruby
Honeybadger.exception_filter do |notice|
  notice[:exception].class < MyError &&
  notice[:params][:name] =~ "bob" &&
  notice[:context][:current_user_id] != 1
end
```
__WARNING:__ While it is possible to use this callback to modify the data that is reported to Honeybadger, this is not officially supported and may not be allowed in future versions of the gem.


## Deployment Tracking 

Honeybadger has an API to keep track of project deployments. Whenever you deploy, all errors for that environment will be resolved automatically. You can choose to enable or disable the auto-resolve feature from your Honeybadger project settings page.

### Capistrano Deployment Tracking

In order to track deployments using Capistrano, simply require Honeybadger's Capistrano task in your `Capfile`&nbsp;file:

```
require "capistrano/honeybadger"
```

If you ran the `honeybadger install` command in a project that was previously configured with Capistrano, we already added this for you.

Adding options to your&nbsp; _config/deploy.rb_&nbsp;file allows you to&nbsp;customize how the deploy task is executed. The syntax for setting them looks like this:

```
set :honeybadger_env, "preprod"
```

You can use any of the following options when configuring capistrano. 

| Option                    |      |
|-------------------------- | ---- |
|`honeybadger_user`         | Honeybadger will report the name of the local user who is deploying (using `whoami` or equivalent). Use this option to to report a different user.|
|`honeybadger_env`          | Honeybadger reports the environment supplied by capistrano by default. Use this option to change the reported environment.|
|`honeybadger_api_key`      | Honeybadger uses your configured API key by default. Use this option to override.|
|`honeybadger_async_notify` | Run deploy notification task asynchronously using `nohup`. True or False. Defaults to false.|
|`honeybadger_server`       | The api endpoint that receives the deployment notification.|
|`honeybadger`              | The name of the honeybadger executable. Default: "honeybadger"|


### Heroku Deployment Tracking

Deploy tracking via Heroku is implemented using Heroku's free [deploy hooks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploy-hooks) addon. To install the addon and configure it for Honeybadger, run the following CLI command from your project root:

```
$ bundle exec honeybadger heroku install_deploy_notification
```

If the honeybadger CLI command fails for whatever reason, you can&nbsp;add the deploy hook manually by running:

```
$ heroku addons:add deployhooks:http --url="https://api.honeybadger.io/v1/deploys?deploy[environment]=production&deploy[local_username]={{user}}&deploy[revision]={{head}}&api_key=asdf" --app app-name
```

You should replace the api key and app-name with your own values. You may also want to change the environment (set to production by default).


### Deployment Tracking Via command line

We provide a CLI command to send deployment notifications manually:

```
bundle exec honeybadger deploy --environment=production
```

Run&nbsp; `bundle exec honeybadger help deploy` for all available options.



## Custom Error Pages

The Honeybadger gem has a few special tags that it looks for whenever you render an error page. These can be used to display extra information about the error, or to ask the user for information about how they triggered the error. 

### Displaying Error ID

When an error is sent to Honeybadger, our API returns a unique UUID for the occurrence within your project. This UUID can be automatically displayed for reference on Rails error pages (e.g. `public/500.html`) or any rack output by including the `Honeybadger::UserInformer` middleware.

To include the error id, simply place this magic HTML comment on your error page: 

```html
<!-- HONEYBADGER ERROR -->
```

By default, we will replace this tag with:

```
Honeybadger Error {{error_id}}
```

Where `{{error_id}}` is the UUID. You can customize this output by overriding the `user_informer.info` option in your honeybadger.yml file (you can also enabled/disable the middleware):

```yaml
user_informer:
  enabled: true
  info: "Error ID: {{error_id}}"
```

You can use that UUID to load the error at the site by going to&nbsp; [https://www.honeybadger.io/notice/UUID](https://www.honeybadger.io/notice/UUID).

### Collecting User Feedback

When an error is sent to Honeybadger, an HTML form can be generated so users can fill out relevant information that led up to that error. Feedback responses are displayed inline in the comments section on the fault detail page.

To include a user feedback form on your error page, simply add this magic HTML comment:

```html
<!-- HONEYBADGER FEEDBACK -->
```
You can change the text displayed in the form via the Rails internationalization system. Here's an example:

```yaml
# config/locales/en.yml
en:
  honeybadger:
    feedback:
      heading: "Care to help us fix this?"
      explanation: "Any information you can provide will help us fix the problem."
      submit: "Send"
      thanks: "Thanks for the feedback!"
      labels:
        name: "Your name"
        email: "Your email address"
        comment: "Comment (required)"
```
