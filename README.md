## Development

Pull requests are welcome. If you're adding a new feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/issues/new) as a preliminary step; that way you can be (moderately) sure that your pull request will be accepted.

If you're integrating your gem/open source project with Honeybadger, please consider submitting an official plugin to our gem. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/issues/new) to discuss with us!

We use [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) to document our API. Classes and methods which are safe to depend on in your gems/projects are marked "Public". All other classes/methods are considered internal and may change without notice -- don't depend on them! If you need a new public API, we're happy to work with you. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/issues/new) to discuss.

### To contribute your code:

1. Fork it.
2. Create a topic branch `git checkout -b my_branch`
3. Make your changes and add an entry to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
4. Commit your changes `git commit -am "Boom"`
5. Push to your branch `git push origin my_branch`
6. Send a [pull request](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/pulls)

### Running the tests

We're using the [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) gem to run
our [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/) test suite against multiple
versions of [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

* The unit test suite can be run with `rake spec:units`.
* The integration test suite can be run with `rake spec:features`.
* The combined suite can be run with `rake`.

### Releasing

To release a new [patch] version:

1. With a clean working tree, use `rake bump:patch` to bump the version and stage the changes (you can make additional manual changes at this point if necessary).
2. Use `rake release` to run the tests, commit/tag the release, build the gem, and push to GitHub/RubyGems.

See `rake -T` for additional tasks.
